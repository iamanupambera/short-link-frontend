# ShortLink v1 - Product Development Plan

## Current Build And Deployment Summary

Last checked: 2026-06-15.

### What Is Built

- NestJS backend project is set up and compiles successfully.
- Auth module exists: register, login, refresh token, logout, email verification, forgot password, reset password, get profile, update profile, and profile picture upload.
- Link module exists: create short URL, custom alias, list links, search/filter links, get one link, update link, delete link, expiration, inactive status, and password hashing for protected links.
- Redirect module exists: short-code redirect, Redis cache lookup, database fallback, expiration check, inactive-link check, password prompt, and async analytics queue push.
- Analytics module exists: total clicks, unique visitors, device stats, browser stats, country stats, referrer stats, dashboard totals, clicks over time, and top links.
- QR module exists: QR code generation and optional PNG download.
- Security basics exist: JWT auth guard, refresh-token cookie rotation, Redis-backed rate limiting, DTO validation, Helmet, CORS, password hashing, IP hashing for analytics, and URL validation blocking localhost/private IP URLs.
- Deployment basics exist: Dockerfile, Docker Compose for app, MySQL, Redis, Prometheus, and Grafana.
- Health and monitoring exist: `/health` and `/metrics`.

### Verified Status

- `npm.cmd run build`: passed.
- `npm.cmd test -- --runInBand`: passed, 4 unit test suites, 19 tests.
- `npm.cmd run test:e2e -- --runInBand`: passed, 1 e2e test.
- `npm.cmd run lint`: passed, 0 errors.

### What Is Remaining Before Launch

- ~~Fix lint errors in `src/config/winston.config.ts`.~~ ✅ Done.
- ~~Add a deployment startup flow for migrations and seed data.~~ ✅ Done via `scripts/docker-entrypoint.sh`.
- ~~Add production environment validation so missing or weak secrets fail fast.~~ ✅ Done via `src/common/utils/env-validation.util.ts`.
- Confirm production values for `CLIENT_URL`, `API_URL`, JWT secrets, Redis password, DB credentials, mail settings, and `IP_SALT_SECRET`.
- ~~Add backup/restore strategy for MySQL.~~ ✅ Done via `scripts/backup-mysql.sh`.
- ~~Add production logs/alerting around errors.~~ ✅ Done — production file transports added to Winston config (`logs/error.log`, `logs/combined.log`).
- Add alerting around queue backlog, redirect latency, DB health, Redis health, and HTTP 5xx rates (Grafana dashboards pending).
- Load test redirect latency and rate limiting against the target: 1M redirects/month and less than 100ms redirect latency. Load test script ready at `scripts/load-test.sh`.
- Add frontend/client app if the product needs a user dashboard UI. The current repo is backend/API focused.
- ~~Expand integration/e2e test coverage for analytics, QR, and full auth lifecycle flows.~~ ✅ Done (209 unit tests and 25 E2E tests covering all core flows).

### Security Issues — Status

- ~~Password-protected redirects currently submit password via query string.~~ ✅ Fixed — now uses POST-based unlock with single-use Redis tokens (60s TTL).
- ~~Uploaded profile images lack file validation.~~ ✅ Fixed — `file-validation.util.ts` validates size (5MB), MIME type, extension, and magic bytes.
- ~~Password policy only checks minimum length.~~ ✅ Fixed — registration and reset DTOs now enforce uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character.
- ~~Forgot-password and resend-verification endpoints reveal whether an email exists.~~ ✅ Fixed — both now return generic success responses regardless of email existence.
- ~~Refresh-token cookie uses `secure: true` always.~~ ✅ Fixed — `secure` flag is now conditional on `NODE_ENV === 'PRODUCTION'`.
- ~~Helmet CSP allows `'unsafe-inline'` without font sources.~~ ✅ Fixed — `fonts.googleapis.com` and `fonts.gstatic.com` added to `styleSrc`/`fontSrc`; `connectSrc` restricted to `'self'`.
- ~~`app.set('trust proxy', 'loopback')` is hardcoded.~~ ✅ Fixed — now configurable via `TRUST_PROXY` env var.
- ~~Docker Compose exposes MySQL and Redis ports publicly.~~ ✅ Fixed — ports bound to `127.0.0.1`.
- Default super-admin seed has a fallback password if `SUPER_ADMIN_PASSWORD` is missing. Consider enforcing explicit credentials for production deployments.
- `.env` exists locally. Ensure it is never committed or copied into images/logs.

### Things That May Break

- ~~Lint currently fails.~~ ✅ Fixed.
- ~~Docker deployment can start the app before migrations are applied.~~ ✅ Fixed — entrypoint runs migrations and seeds before app start; depends_on uses health checks.
- The app depends on Redis for sessions, rate limiting, cache, and analytics queue. If Redis is down, login/session behavior, redirects, rate limits, and analytics can degrade or fail.
- ~~The original plan says UUID IDs, but implementation uses integer IDs.~~ ✅ Design doc updated to match implementation (integer IDs).
- ~~Local file uploads may be lost on container rebuild/redeploy.~~ ✅ Fixed — `./public/uploads` mounted as a persistent volume in Docker Compose.
- ~~Password-protected links use GET form submission.~~ ✅ Fixed — now uses POST form submission with ephemeral unlock tokens.
- ~~Test coverage has improved (19 unit tests across 4 suites + 1 e2e test) but more flows should be covered.~~ ✅ Fixed (now has 209 unit tests across 26 suites, and 25 E2E tests).

### Launch Readiness

Current status: backend MVP is feature-complete and buildable. Core security issues have been addressed. Remaining work is operational hardening and expanding test coverage.

Recommended next steps:

1. ~~Fix lint.~~ ✅ Done.
2. ~~Fix password-protected redirect password handling.~~ ✅ Done.
3. ~~Add upload validation.~~ ✅ Done.
4. ~~Add migration startup/deployment process.~~ ✅ Done.
5. ~~Expand integration tests for remaining core launch flows.~~ ✅ Done.
6. Run Docker Compose end-to-end with a clean database.
7. Load test redirect and analytics paths using `scripts/load-test.sh`.
